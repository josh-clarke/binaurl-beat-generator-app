# Binaural Beat Generator PWA - Project Context

## Project Overview
A Progressive Web Application (PWA) that generates binaural beats, isochronic beats, and noise for meditation, focus, and relaxation purposes.

## Core Requirements

### Audio Generation Features
- Binaural beat generation (different frequencies in left and right ears)
- Isochronic beat generation (pulsing single frequency)
- Noise generation (white, pink, brown)
- Multiple simultaneous tracks with individual controls
- 5-second fade-in when starting audio
- 2-second fade-out when stopping audio

### User Interface Requirements
- Track management (add/remove tracks)
- Per-track volume controls
- Master volume control
- Timer functionality
- Preset management (save/load configurations)

### Track Configuration
- Binaural beat tracks:
  - Carrier frequency setting (median frequency)
  - Automatic calculation of left/right channel frequencies
  - Beat frequency setting
- Isochronic beat tracks:
  - Carrier frequency setting
  - Beat frequency setting (controls pulse rate)
- Noise tracks:
  - Noise type selection (white, pink, brown)

### PWA Requirements
- Offline functionality
- Home screen installation
- Mobile and desktop responsive design

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Web Audio API for sound generation
- IndexedDB for storing presets
- Service Workers for offline functionality

### Component Structure
1. Audio Engine
2. User Interface
3. Preset Management
4. PWA Configuration

## Development Plan
The project will be broken down into discrete tasks assigned to specialized experts.

## Task Tracking

### Completed Tasks
1. **PWA Scaffold Setup** - Basic project structure with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, manifest, service worker, and icons
2. **Core Audio Engine Implementation** - Created modular audio system with:
   - Base Track class with common functionality
   - Specialized track types (Binaural, Isochronic, Noise)
   - AudioController for managing multiple tracks
   - Support for all required audio features (fade in/out, volume control, timer)
3. **Preset Management System** - Implemented IndexedDB-based system for:
   - Saving/loading named configurations
   - Storing all track parameters, master settings, and timer values
   - Converting between AudioController state and stored preset format
   - Error handling and user feedback
4. **Basic UI Structure and Layout** - Implemented foundational UI elements:
   - Responsive dark-themed design for meditation/focus context
   - Header, main content areas, and footer
   - Placeholder components for all major controls
   - Mobile-friendly layout with CSS Grid/Flexbox
   - Consistent styling with CSS variables and transitions
5. **Master Controls UI Functionality** - Implemented global audio controls:
   - Play/Stop button with visual feedback and fade effects
   - Master volume slider with real-time adjustment and persistence
   - Timer functionality with countdown display and automatic stop
   - Created UIController for global state management
   - Connected preset dropdown to PresetManager for loading configurations
6. **Track Management UI and Control Panels** - Implemented track-specific functionality:
   - Add Track button with track type selection (Binaural, Isochronic, Noise)
   - Dynamic track panel creation with appropriate controls for each type
   - Track removal with smooth animations
   - Track-specific parameter controls (frequencies, noise type, volume)
   - Real-time parameter updates with audio feedback
   - Mobile-optimized collapsible panels
7. **Enhanced Frequency Controls** - Implemented dual input methods for frequency parameters:
   - Direct numerical input with up to 2 decimal place precision
   - Clickable frequency displays that transform into editable fields
   - Validation for input ranges with user feedback
   - Synchronized slider and numerical input values
   - Improved user experience with visual cues for editable fields
   - Keyboard navigation support between controls

### Completed Tasks (continued)
8. **Final Integration and Testing** - Comprehensive testing and optimization:
   - Cross-browser compatibility verified in major browsers
   - Mobile responsiveness and touch controls optimized
   - Performance improvements for smooth audio transitions
   - PWA features fully implemented and tested
   - User experience refinements with tooltips and feedback
   - Documentation and code cleanup completed

### Pending Tasks
All planned tasks for the initial version have been completed. The application is ready for use.
