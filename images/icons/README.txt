ICON GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS

The manifest.json file references several icon sizes that need to be created:
- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png
- favicon.ico

To generate these icons, you can:

1. Use online tools like:
   - Real Favicon Generator (https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
   - PWA Builder (https://www.pwabuilder.com/)
   - Favicon.io (https://favicon.io/)

2. Use design software like Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or Photoshop to create icons
   based on the SVG template design described below:

Icon Design Concept:
- Dark background (#121212)
- Two overlapping circles representing left and right audio channels
- Left circle in purple (#6b5ce7)
- Right circle in blue (#3a9cd7)
- Connected by a dotted line

When creating icons, ensure they:
- Have transparent backgrounds for the PWA icons
- Are clearly visible at small sizes
- Maintain consistent branding across all sizes

Once generated, place all icon files in this directory.
