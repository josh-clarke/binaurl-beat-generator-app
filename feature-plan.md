# Binaural Beat Generator - Feature Enhancement Plan

## New Feature Requirements

1. **Audio Export Functionality**
   - Export sequences to WAV or MP3 files
   - Support various duration exports
   - Maintain all audio characteristics during export

2. **Adjustable Fade Timing**
   - Add controls to customize fade in/out durations
   - Change defaults to 2s fade-in and 1s fade-out
   - Save fade settings in presets

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Audio Engine Enhancements

#### Task 1.1: Implement Adjustable Fade Timing
- Modify `AudioController` class to accept custom fade in/out parameters
- Update the fade-in/fade-out logic to use these parameters
- Set new defaults (2s fade-in, 1s fade-out)
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing presets

#### Task 1.2: Create Audio Export Core
- Implement recording capability using Web Audio API's `MediaRecorder`
- Create buffer management system for captured audio data
- Implement WAV encoding (native browser support)
- Add MP3 encoding using a JavaScript library (lamejs or similar)
- Create export duration management system

### Phase 2: UI Components

#### Task 2.1: Fade Settings UI
- Add fade duration controls to master settings panel
- Implement numeric inputs with validation
- Add visual indicators for current fade settings
- Create reset-to-defaults option

#### Task 2.2: Export UI Controls
- Design and implement export button/panel in the UI
- Create export settings modal:
  - File format selection (WAV/MP3)
  - Quality/bitrate options
  - Duration input
  - Filename input
- Implement progress indicators for export process
- Add success/error notifications

### Phase 3: Data Management

#### Task 3.1: Preset System Updates
- Extend preset data structure to include fade in/out settings
- Update `PresetManager` to handle these additional parameters
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing presets

#### Task 3.2: Export File Management
- Implement download trigger for completed exports
- Add file naming conventions and validation
- Create export history (optional)

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing

#### Task 4.1: Integration
- Connect all components of the export system
- Link fade settings UI to audio engine
- Ensure all components work together seamlessly

#### Task 4.2: Comprehensive Testing
- Test exports of various durations and configurations
- Verify file integrity and audio quality
- Test on multiple browsers and devices
- Performance testing with complex multi-track configurations

## Technical Considerations

### Export Performance
- Audio export can be resource-intensive
- Implement chunking for long exports
- Consider Web Workers for background processing
- Add memory usage monitoring

### Browser Compatibility
- `MediaRecorder` API has varying support across browsers
- Implement feature detection and graceful fallbacks
- Provide clear messaging for unsupported browsers

### User Experience
- Provide clear feedback during export process
- Implement cancelation for in-progress exports
- Add estimated file size indicators
- Consider implementing maximum duration limits based on browser capabilities

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 2: 1 week
- Phase 3: 1 week
- Phase 4: 1 week
- Total estimated development time: 4-5 weeks

## Deployment Strategy
- Develop in a feature branch
- Implement progressive rollout
- Gather initial user feedback
- Full deployment after fixing any identified issues
